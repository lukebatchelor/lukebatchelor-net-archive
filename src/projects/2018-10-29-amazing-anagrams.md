## Idea

I've tried pretty much every anagram app on the internet and none have quite done what I need. They all fall for the same trap of trying to create the entire anagram at once, usually ending up with either no results (because there was no wiggle room for what counts as a "word") or with too many results that you can't find anything useful in!.

The idea with this app is to let you itertively find individual words and explore what is left, allowing you much more flexibility to *find* what you're looking for, rather than having it given to you.

*More details to be added*
